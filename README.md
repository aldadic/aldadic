Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Aleksandar Dadic, but most people know me as [Sascha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_(name)#Usage). 
Recently, I graduated with a master's degree in technical mathematics from [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/). 
In my studies I focused on applied mathematics, i.e.,

- calculus and numerical mathematics,
- partial differential equations,
- modelling and simulation,
- various computer science topics (such as machine learning).

I also used to work as a student assistant in the workgroup [Numerics of PDEs](https://www.tuwien.at/mg/asc/numpdes) and was involved in [TUForMath](https://tuformath.at/) for many years.
In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with tech, which is why my hobbies include programming, self-hosting, home automation, and 3D printing.

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Aleksandar Dadic, but most people know me as [Sascha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_(name)#Usage). 
Currently I am pursuing a master's degree in technical mathematics at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/). 
In my studies I focus on applied mathematics, i.e.

- calculus and numerical mathematics,
- partial differential equations,
- modelling and simulation,
- various computer science topics.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with tech, which is why my hobbies include

- programming,
- self-hosting,
- home automation,
- 3D printing.
